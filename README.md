# Wind-Prediction

## Scope of this project
This project aims to use ML models to predict Wind Speed based on historical data. We Benchmarked our model predictions against Pyrecast(NBM) wind predictions. After that, the Wind Speed prediction was converted into energy production prediction based on the wind turbine locations and model-type power curves. The final results were presented in Google Earth Engine.

## Datasets used in this project
